Select "Download latest reposity catalogues" - it is before GPL Acceptance
Tick MinGW Developer Toolkit in the select components window
open mingw shell
cd to where you wanna be in windows from the mingw shell
C:\ is actually /c/ in mingw
ie: cd /c/dev/sdltest
download http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL-1.3.zip in windows and unzip it into sdltest or wherever
open sdltest/sdl-1.3.0-5538 in mingw

./configure
make
make install

go back to sdltest/
gcc main.c -o sdltest.exe -lmingw32 `sdl-config --cflags --libs`

-- ONLY IF YOU WANT TO RUN IT OUTSIDE OF MINGW --
	we need the dll 
	copy sdl.dll from C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\local\bin
	put that in sdltest dir

fuck about, compile using the gcc line above and you should be able to run it in mingw using ./sdltest.exe or in windows by just double clicking it.
